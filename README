# Node.js Express Server with Google Authentication (OpenID Connect & OAuth2)

## Overview
This repository contains a sample Node.js Express server that implements Google authentication using the OpenID Connect protocol with OAuth 2.0. It's designed as a foundational starting point for web applications requiring user authentication via Google.

## Features
- **Google Authentication**: Users can sign in using their Google accounts.
- **OpenID Connect Protocol**: Securely authenticates users and provides user information using tokens.
- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework for user access delegation.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions post-authentication.

## Technologies
- **Node.js & Express**: Utilizes Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **openid-client**: A server-side client for authentication with an OpenID Connect provider.

## Getting Started
